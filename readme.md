## Maze Run

A simple Javascript maze game. Objective of the game is to move the ball to the goal by finding your way through the maze which is being generated randomly at every refresh.

# Controls

Use _w_,_a_,_s_,_d_ or the arrow keys to move the ball to the destination.

# Technologies/Library used:

HTML, CSS , Javascript, MatterJS

# Features

1. It is highly scalable.
2. Mazes generated randomly are respective of the screen size available to render them.
3. Use of recursion.
4. Project involves use of tree like structure for building the UI.
5. Fun and challenging.

# Bugs

1. There is a bug with matterJS which makes the object to break-free of the container if the animated object genrates high velocity. Have kept the change in force as minimum as possible to avoid this bug.

# Features that I may add in future

1. Diffferent difficult modes and generating mazez based on the mode.
2. Adding touch controls for mobile and tablet devices.
3. Hoping to replicate the project in some 3D Javasccript library like babylonJS
